## Representational structure in neural time series using calcium imaging and electrophysiology

### Instructors
**Quinn Lee, PhD** is a CIHR/FRQ postdoctoral research fellow in the Brandon Lab at McGill University (Montreal, QC, Canada). Prior to joining the Brandon Lab, he completed my PhD at the University of Lethbridge (Lethbridge, AB, Canada) with Drs. Robert Sutherland and Robert McDonald studying how long-term memory is organized at the systems-level in the brain. His current work aims to understand how aspects of experience and memory are represented in neuronal population activity in the rodent hippocampus across protracted experience. To this end, he uses a combination of miniscope calcium imaging in freely moving animals, advanced behavioral tracking, and computational methods to explore questions about neuronal representation and behavior.

**Giuseppe P Gava, PhD** is a postdoctoral neuroscientist in the Dupret Lab at the MRC BNDU, University of Oxford. He was awarded a PhD from the Centre for Doctoral Training in Neurotechnology at Imperial College London, where he also graduated in Biomedical Engineering. He aims to use concepts from network science, topology and information theory to understand the complex neural circuitry and dynamics that shape memory and cognition.

### Objectives
 * Data analysis for in vivo calcium imaging time series from freely-behaving animals
 * Data analysis for electrophysiological time series from freely-behaving animals
 * Compare representation in neural data to theoretical models with representational similarity analysis (RSA) and manifold-based analyses
 * Assess the co-firing structure and topology of neuronal networks and compare them using Riemannian metrics.

**Title**: What's the endgame of neuroAI?

**Summary**: Neuroscience and AI have a long, intertwined history. Artificial intelligence pioneers looked to the principles of the organization of the brain as inspiration to make intelligent machines. In a surprising reversal, AI is now helping us understand its very source of inspiration: the human brain. Over the next decade, we’ll make ever more precise in silico brain models. As a result, we’ll soon be able to download and use sensory models, on demand, with the same convenience that we can do object recognition or natural language processing.

In this talk, I will take you on a tour of the near future. I will argue that we should use this newfound capability to help improve human health, both for people with neurological disorders and to enhance the well. I discuss enabling technological trends: advances in AI, industrial use cases, AR/VR and BCI. I invite everyone to reflect on the role of innovation and academia to help humans flourish.

**Elizabeth Dupre, PhD** is a [Wu Tsai interdisciplinary postdoctoral research fellow](https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/people/elizabeth-dupre) at Stanford University, working between Prof. Russ [Poldrack](https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/) and Prof. Scott [Linderman](https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/). As a psychologist and computational neuroscientist, her work focuses on modeling individual brain activity across a range of cognitive states—and assessing the generalizability of these individualized models—by extending statistical methods for human neuroimaging data analysis. Through her work, Dr DuPre has taken an active role developing tools in the open source Python ecosystem, with a focus on improving the reproducibility of analysis workflows.

**Title**: Aligning representations in brains and machines

**Summary**: Computational neuroscience is focused on uncovering general organizational principles supporting neural activity and behavior; however, uncovering these principles relies on making appropriate comparisons across individuals. This presents a core technical and conceptual challenge, as individuals differ along nearly every relevant dimension: from the number of neurons supporting computation to the exact computation being performed. Similarly in artificial neural networks, multiple initializations of the same architecture—on the same data—may recruit non-overlapping hidden units, complicating direct comparisons of trained networks.

In this talk, I will introduce techniques for aligning representations in both brains and in machines. I will argue for the importance of considering alignment methods in developing a comprehensive science at the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience that reflects our shared goal of understanding principles of computation. Finally, I will consider current applications and limitations of these techniques, discussing relevant future directions for this area.

## Brain decoding

Within this session, we will go through the basics of running/applying `decoding models`
to `fMRI` data. More precisely, we will explore how we can utilize different `decoding models`
to `estimate`/`predict` what an agent is `perceiving` or `doing` based on `recordings` of `responses`/`activity`.
Given the time restrictions, we will focus on `biological agents`, ie `human participants`, and thus `brain` `responses` obtained from `fMRI`.
