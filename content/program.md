 * 08:50-09:00 **Welcome** (room FPHEC)
 * 09:00-10:20 **Cognitive benchmarking in large models part I** (room FPHEC)
 * 10:20-10:40 **break with coffee and snack** (room FPHEC)
 * 10:40-12:00 **Cognitive benchmarking in large models part II** (room FPHEC)
 * 12:00-12:45 **Lunch provided** (room FPHEC)
 * 12:45-13:55 **Videogames and RL for neuroAI part I** (room FPHEC)
 * 14:10-15:15 **Videogames and RL for neuroAI part II** (room Tkaronto)
 * 15:15-15:35 **Break with coffee and snack** (room Tkaronto)
 * 15:35-17:30 **Computation in NeurAI: a dynamical systems persective** (room Tkaronto)
